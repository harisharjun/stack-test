**Let’s go back to the 1600s for a while.**

### Experiment from Leaning Tower of Pisa
Most of you would have heard of Galileo. If not, he is the one known for his famous experiment of dropping two objects of different weights from the ‘Leaning Tower of Pisa’. His experiment contradicted what Aristotle had taught before: heavier objects fall faster than a lighter objects. And as the experiment reveals both the objects hit the ground almost at the same time, busting the popular belief till then.

Isn’t it very intuitive to think that a lighter object will obviously take more time than a heavier object? We experience this phenomenon daily - if a pen and paper slip away from a table, the pen hits the ground first, isn’t it? It is a fact that the pen hits first, but we do not tend to think beyond the easy evidence. The easy evidence is that pen weighs more than the paper, so we correlate the weight of the object to the time taken.

Unfortunately, that is not true. A few experiments (as Galileo and others had done) would reveal that the shape of the object, the density, the buoyancy and air friction determine the time taken, not the weight per se! And this was quite a revelation back then. Due to these and a lot of other discoveries, Galileo would be called the ‘father of modern physics’ by many.

### Sun or Earth, which one is the centre?
Let’s look at another work by Galileo that questioned a more popular and widely accepted belief in society - heliocentrism (the concept that the sun is at the centre).

Also known as Copernicanism, derived from the name of renowned mathematician Nicolaus Copernicus who first built mathematical models for theoretical explanations, heliocentrism is the astronomical model in which the Sun is at the centre of the universe and the Earth and other planets revolve around it. This was in contradiction with the popular belief of geocentrism, which placed the Earth at the centre.

Galileo successfully provided physical evidence to explain this phenomenon, but the then community disregarded his claims and forced him to accept that the Earth only was the centre of the universe. And due to this, in 1633, Galileo was ordered to stand trial, was imprisoned for a few years and was then held on house arrest for the rest of his life!

But why was it so difficult for people to believe this newly proposed way of the planetary system which has some scientific explanation?

In the Catholic world prior to Galileo's conflict, geocentrism agreed with the literal interpretation of the Bible in several places: Chronicles 16:30, Psalm 93:1, Psalm 96:10, Psalm 104:5, Ecclesiastes 1:5 and all the people subscribed to this view as it has also got references in the bible itself.

**I would like to highlight two takeaways from the above two anecdotes:**

#### From anecdote 1:
A belief could be false no matter how popular or intuitive it is, and it takes rigorous experiments to prove it

#### From anecdote 2:
No matter how scientific an experiment and explanation is for a phenomenon, people will not be ready to change their beliefs. In fact, people take extreme measures to safeguard their beliefs than try to find out the truth

**What is Galileo doing in an article that is supposed to be on psychology, you wonder?**

These two anecdotes are only to convey how our beliefs are very difficult to understand, difficult to prove and difficult to change. And thus, a lot of what we say, what we do and what we decide are based on these true or false beliefs, knowingly or unknowingly.

That brings us to what is called a **‘Belief Bias’**:\
***"We judge an argument’s strength not by how strongly it supports the conclusion but by how plausible the conclusion is in our minds."***

## The belief dilemma
### Personal story 1
My first startup was WhatsDplan. We started WhatsDdplan because we believed in the idea. And frankly, this belief is good. Without any belief, you wouldn’t achieve anything great. Belief is needed to do something which otherwise would not have been possible. If you want to conquer the moon you need to first believe it and then only will you be able to experience it. But even for that, you need to have a very good grasp of reality and be drown in a false sense of belief.

My assessment about ‘WhatsDplan’, if I recollect some of the discussions I have had with a few investors and also with a few of my friends and colleagues, was riveted around belief. Rather than a strong argument on ‘why’ exactly would it work, I thought it will work because ‘WE’ were building it and we were good. We were invested in the idea since the beginning and did not want to doubt it even for a little while. And the startup ended in a tragedy. We had to shut it down after a year-long effort to make it work.

### Personal story 2
Recently, I was having a conversation with a friend. He has had a troubled past and was still figuring it out - about his life and career. He has tried his hand at a variety of things, but nothing concrete. He hopped from one thing to another after giving it a try for a short while - from analytics to data science to finance to consulting to starting up. He lacked focus.

As we were having a conversation about what could he possibly do next, he said he wanted to pursue UPSC! I was shocked. He believed that he could just do it because he thought so. There was no strong argument for it. All he said was, ‘because I want to do it, I will do it!’ But I knew that this was another whim he was having. As his past suggested, he struggled to keep focus in getting a job as an analyst, I knew, he would not have the required focus and dedication required to crack UPSC. But he was just driven by it though without a credible argument.

I couldn’t convince him out of it. I am still wondering how do we make someone realise if they are so driven just by beliefs!

#### The belief bias is not just seen at a personal level like the above examples. We are exposed to it as a society, as a community and as a global fraternity as well.

**Let’s take a look at some examples**

### The age-old patriarchy
It took me one complete season of Money Heist to realise that patriarchy is ingrained in a lot of things we do on a daily basis. I do not want to go into the details of the heist, but on the face of it, we think we are quite liberal in our thinking and believe that we are not being biased based on gender. But, if we critically assess everything we do on a daily basis, we realise that we have taken so many things for granted:
* assuming power
* judging based on gender rather than intellect or physical capacity
* taking unanimous decisions without any consultation
* preconceived roles and responsibilities
* entrusting ownership without power
* a lot more

There could be reasons for some of the practices (not the above) that bestow roles for males and females in the society which is good, which further our progress as a society, but for many, they are simply followed because they are just laid out there, for no other reason.

### Buying a car gives a good life
I have many friends who believe that having a car gives a good life. Ask them why, and they say a car is needed, no? The argument dies at the beginning itself. There could be many reasons how a car improves the lifestyle (if not life) which is fine, but a deeper thought is not given into these when such a purchase is made. It is bought because ‘we need a car, right?’

### The silly bad omens
There are many instances in my childhood when we did a few things just because we believed them to be true!

Let's take a look at one such incident. We are three kids in our family - my brother, sister and I. I vividly remember the incident when we had to go to a nearby relative. We had to attend a function at the night and had to walk to the relative’s place. ‘We should not travel in groups of three’, we were told. As we were three of us, we believed that it was not good for us. My sister picked up a stone from the ground, put it in the purse and were then good to go. We had ‘stone’ as the fourth member, can you believe it?

Sounds silly, right? It is!

**There are more:**
* Looking into a broken mirror is bad luck. (You can judge me, but I am still scared to look into a broken mirror!)
* A black cat crossing the path is bad luck

### More examples:
* Graduating from an IIT gives a good life
* Charity is donating some money to an NGO
* Our religion is superior to the other
* My responsibility as a citizen is just to cast my vote

Many of our beliefs are formed because of what we see and perceive from society, the environment and everything happening around us. We ponder on some, question some, but accept many as they are. We develop some form of intuition with things and how to deal with them. We take them for granted on the face of it. As we develop these beliefs, when we encounter a similar situation and respond to it, we consider it to be valid without critically looking at the situation.

Because of social conditioning, we are simply said to follow a few things and believe in a few things because it makes life easy or fits someone’s way of how life should be lived, or what leads to a fulfilling life. It may broaddly be true, but not applicable for everyone, in every situation every time. There will be exceptions and we need to embrace those exceptions, for those exceptions and the ability to tread them with required attention separates the good from the great.

You should not do something because someone said so and you simply believe in it. You should only believe in it because you have validated it. And sometimes, you need to learn from others’ experiences, validate them with various arguments, carefully question the conclusion and then believe in it!

Though intuition is good as it helps us decide faster without wasting our precious time and energy, there is one problem: it may not be right always! So, we need to be aware and cautious of how we are coming to some conclusion. And correct ourselves from time to time.

I mean, we believe in, as kids, what our parents say, our teachers say, our elders say and we carry them with ourselves as we grow. But the world changes with time and so does our ability to understand and assess things. What you were told to be true may not hold good at a later point in time. Hence, it is advised to question the premise of the belief(s) or the belief system itself from time to time.

It is hard to question the existing set of notions and beliefs - sometimes because  we don’t know that our decisions are driven by them and sometimes because we do not want to put ourselves in the struggle of pursuit of truth as we are lazy and afraid! So, it is hard to control our existing belief systems from interfering in our objective decision making. It requires training, a lot of it, just like overcoming any other cognitive bias.

**Here are a few things that you could do to safeguard yourself from this bias.**

* Look for objective reasons. If you think something is true or something is the best thing to do, look for objective reasons why it could be true. Don’t get carried away by the end result just because that seems plausible or intuitive
* Break the end result into smaller measurable chunks that could be objectively assessed. Assessing smaller pieces is easier compared to assessing the whole
* List down all the different reasons why the belief could be wrong. And disprove them! Rather than cherishing why it could be right, focus on why it could be ‘wrong’. Until you find all the reasons why it could not be wrong, you do not believe it
