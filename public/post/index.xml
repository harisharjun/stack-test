      <description>Hooked is one of those books which I would recommend to every aspiring Product Manager. In fact, anyone who is even sparsely connected with human psychology or behaviour should read this. It is a short, quick read and insightful with some clever real-world examples.
While reading the book, I had collated some important and wow moments in my notepad. I wanted to share them with others and thus this article. Please note that this in no way is the gist of the book!</description>

      <description>Many of us either in the school, or at work, or in any of the great speeches would have heard of the difference between effectiveness and efficiency. Give it a thought, pause for a minute and think about what effectiveness is and what efficiency is? Think of your own daily activities… can you name at least one activity in which you are very effective and one activity in which you are very efficient?</description>

      <description>When the exam results are out, your heart would skip a beat. It is natural to get anxious and you would get restless until you check the result. You quickly open the computer, search Google and get a list of websites. You will most probably click three or four links, thanks to Google. Any delay will add to those small moments of anxiety. What goes through your mind? How do you feel when you type your hall ticket number and the page starts loading?</description>

🚀 WhatsDplan In 2015, Ramesh Kumar Katreddi and I started WhatsDplan. We had deliberated quite a lot on the product we wanted to build and out of the numerous ideas we had, we narrowed it down to one and started building it.</description>

      <title>01 Confirmation Bias</title>

      <description>Cognitive Biases Cognitive Biases are a set of unwritten guidelines that nudge us to make decisions and take actions. They reduce our mental or intellectual effort to process information and make rational choices. We generally follow them without our awareness and in total submission. We follow them as they reduce our cognitive overload.
We, very commonly, fall into the trap of these biases as they are easy to follow, reduce the stress and efforts to decide and take an action.</description>

      <title>The Heartfulness Way</title>

      <description>It would be foolish of me if I proclaim that I was able to understand everything discussed in the book. ‘The Heartfulness Way’ is not a preaching which is to be read and understood in the first place. It, rather, is a way of life which needs to be practiced, experienced and felt deep inside. It helps in giving a direction and presents a way to look into one’s own self, lead a peaceful life and attain the real purpose of our life.</description>
