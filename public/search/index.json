[{"content":"👋🏼 Hello! Thank you for stopping by.\n😀 Please note that this is the sixth in a series of articles I am writing on Cognitive Biases. If you haven’t read the other five yet, I’d recommend you read them first. Links below:\n Confirmation Bias ✅ Fundamental Attribution Error ✅ Ikea effect ✅ Availability Heuristic ✅ Framing effect ✅   What is the Forer effect?  We easily attribute our personalities to vague statements, even if they apply to a wide range of people.\n In 1948, psychologist Bertram R. Forer conducted an experiment on his students where each student was given a set of statements (about themselves) like:\n “Although you do have some weaknesses, you try very hard to overcome them and be a better person.” “You are an independent thinker who takes pride in doing things differently than others.” “You have an intense desire to get people to accept and like you.” “Sometimes you give too much effort on projects that don’t work out.”  The students were then asked to rate how accurately those statements described themselves on a scale of 5. What was surprising was, though the statements were very generic, the average rating of all the students was 4.3/5 which indicated that the students found those statements highly relevant to themselves! Based on the results, Forer declared the presence of this effect where people tend to accept positive sweeping generic statements about themselves as though those statements are solely made for them.\nThis is also called as the Barnum effect. named after P. T. Barum who declared that ‘a sucker is born every minute’ — meaning people are gullible and want to believe what they are told, so they think that general statements are solely about themselves. This effect is also less commonly called the ‘Barnum-Forer effect.’\n Let me explain how this translates into our everyday life, the products we use, and the things we do on a daily basis.\nAs always, some personal story.\nShaadi kab hai? It is that time in my life (or am I way past that time!) when everybody around me keeps asking, ‘when’s your marriage?’ And being such a bore that I am, I do not have a girlfriend and to add to that, there is a pandemic going on with lockdown imposed everywhere and palpable distress all around. I have had my share of difficulties in finding the ONE.\nEnter the new age of online dating and online matrimony. The online dating and matrimony Apps would come to my rescue, or so I thought! Where do I start? Ummm… This subject is so delicate that it is super easy to get scammed. I mean it. Of all the myriad features these Apps have, around filters, pricing, preferences, interests etc, I would like to talk about the king of all — the ‘Matches for you’ feature. The ‘matches for you’ feature is supposed to recommend the most suitable ‘match’ for you. It is, however, irritating that they do not.\nI mean, neither were those matches relevant nor do they make any sense! When I started, the suggestions were super random, highly irrelevant. I was hoping they would get better with my profile, all my details, and my usage. It was only over time that I got convinced that they were not going to get any better!\nThey use a simple make-believe tactic… that the suggestions are actually tailored for me by presenting them that way. In reality, they are not tailored! The recommendations are made universally applicable to all those who even sparsely have some of my traits. I too believed that those recommendations were really for me for a few days until I realised they were not. And now, I don’t bother much, you see. Reality has dawned upon me and I am still waiting for that miracle to happen… Where Arjuna finally meets his Subhadra. Ahem!\nWell, now, whenever I see, ‘Recommended for you’ (not just in the matrimony Apps but also in all the other Apps I use: YouTube, Swiggy, Cure.fit, Netflix etc) — I immediately question whether if they are actually relevant for me or if they are simply imposed upon me. Rather than taking the suggestions for granted, I try to take a moment to pause think through and proceed. This pausing and taking a moment takes effort, a lot of effort. Multiply this with the number of times we come across these situations… it’s unimaginable! We need to consciously train our mind to do so, which we don’t!\nYou see, companies impose something on us because it might bring more value to them that way; doing it that way might be in their self-interest and not yours always. Being a Product Manager myself, I subscribe to the fact that users interests should always be at the forefront. Unfortunately, that is not how things are run always. Ethical product building should take precedence over profit-making, morally. Unfortunately, that’s not the reality. Simply put, you are the buyer — you must be beware!\n Let’s look at another more familiar and relatable example.\nThe case of horoscopes and jyothishis (astrologers) My brother gets super excited when he reads the daily horoscope predictions in The Times of India newspaper. I can bet that his excitement wouldn’t subside even by a bit if the TOI swapped the ‘Aries’ prediction with the ‘Saggitarius’ one. The statements which are written are so generic that a street hawker would find the same relevance to them as the CEO sitting in a high-end corporate office.\nThe same is the case with most of the jyothishis! Don’t believe me? Let me tell you another of my personal stories.\nIt was during my Engineering days, in the year 2007. I had done extremely well in the AIEEE that year. The word was out and some of my relatives did see me as if I was some alien and I was basking in all the glory, I mean, why not! I had gone to my cousin’s place during those holidays to cherish even more. We were watching TV when a jyothishi came to visit us. I didn’t realise what was happening. After the elders exchanged some words, the jyothishi smiled at me and briskly walked towards me. Took my palm into his, and said things (which make me laugh even today) like, ‘very bright future, very good boy. Nice. Will go abroad soon. The family will become proud. Keep it up, beta’. It’s been 14 years and I am still waiting for Hyderabad to be declared as a new country.\nThe jyothishi’s statements were so vague and generic that it was ironic how such clear, simple, and direct statements did not make any sense at all! The saddest part, however, was that my sister and mom bought into them!\nI am not trying to generalise all the astrologers here. Maybe some predict well, maybe some don’t. I am just stating how gullible we people are to statements even though they are very generic and universally applicable.\n More examples Another online product where the Forer effect is used brilliantly which created quite some craze among the users is the ‘Know your personality’ game on the Facebook feed. I have seen people share things like ‘You are loyal’, ‘You are good at heart’, ‘You make others smile’, ‘You are like a tiger, ferocious yet caring for your family’ on their feed and as WhatsApp statuses! In fact, I have had conversations with some of them and was surprised by their conviction about their personality based on the results from these games, in spite of these statements being ridiculously generic!\nThe problem is not when some positive reinforcement happens. Positive reinforcement is good, though ethically questionable and factually incorrect. The problem arises when people attribute themselves to a false sense of reality or when some negative reinforcement happens. And we being humans, succumb to such instances as we do not want to trouble ourselves. When someone starts to believe in something because someone said so without pondering over the correctness of it or putting in an effort to validate if such a thing is true or not is when the trouble begins.\nThere are many other situations where this happens:\n Tried the weighing machine at the bus station or the railway station? The weight card has a ‘personal message’ for you! (no it doesn’t) Received a personal email from the CEO of a company? Hmmm… Looks like the CEO really cares for you! (not really) A salesperson told you he took a high-level approval to give you the discount? Maybe you should buy the product right away! (please, don’t) Being born in April do you get excited by reading, ‘Legends are born in April’? You probably are a legend, you should get that tattooed! (oh, no! don’t do it) A news article says that Indians are good at math. You get 30 out of 100 in the class test and yet you feel proud. I guess you should! (no, please!) Received a ‘only for you’ 40% discount notification on Heytm? Maybe they love you more than every other user! (they don’t!)  Conclusion It is true that companies these days use data to create personalization. However, it is extremely difficult to tailor things for you and most of the online products (Netflix, Spotify, Swiggy, Twitter and the like) still have a lot of catching up to do. And till that catching up is done, these companies will present generalization in the disguise of personalization.\nSo, whenever someone says that something is exclusively recommended for you, remember that it most probably is not! And whenever you come across generic statements about yourself, just smile and move along, you are better than those generic statements… only you need to question and find out yourself!\n Thank you for reading! 🙏🏼\n👍🏼 ➡️ If you liked it, please share it with others who might find it interesting!\n💬 Also, please leave your comment or feedback below.\n ","date":"2021-06-22T00:04:18+05:30","image":"https://stack-test-a41a1.web.app/p/forer-effect/forer_hucb76e60b581c73ff06dc4c86d9b587cb_1023327_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://stack-test-a41a1.web.app/p/forer-effect/","title":"06 Forer Effect"},{"content":"👋🏼 Hello! Thank you for stopping by.\n😀 Please note that this is the fifth in a series of articles I am writing on Cognitive Biases. If you haven’t read the other four yet, I’d recommend you read them first. Links below:\n Confirmation Bias ✅ Fundamental Attribution Error ✅ Ikea effect ✅ Availability Heuristic ✅   Ok, let’s get started with this one.\nDwapar Yug, Dronacharya and the elephant Mahabharata, the epic tale between the two groups of cousins, the Kauravas and the Pandavas, is a tale of a multitude of human desires, emotions and grit and vengeance. Many of its learnings are used in management, leadership and growth. Let’s start with one such small chronicle from this hell of a tale.\nWithout going into details, let me try and drive the point.\nIt is the time of the Kurukshetra War. After the death of Bheeshmacharya, Dronacharya becomes the commander-in-chief of the Kaurava army. Krishna knew that Dronacharya was formidable and with him in charge, it was impossible to defeat the Kauravas.\nThe only way to remove Dronacharya was to convince him that his son, Ashwathama, was dead. With his son gone, Dronacharya would give up and he could only then be killed. Krishna, the greatest trickster, devises a plan.\nAshwathama, who was considered one of the greatest warriors, was not easy to kill. Hence the trick!\nAs per Krishna’s plan, Bheema kills an elephant named Ashwathama after which Yudhisthir declares, ‘Ashwathama hatha (loudly), iti narova kunjarova (whispers)’. Dronacharya who heard this was able to gather only the first half of the sentence, and with Yudhisthir, who was the epitome of Dharma (righteousness), declaring such an event, Dronacharya believed it to be true and gave up himself in the war field, and was then taken down!\nThis, for me, is a classic case of the framing effect. Dronacharya placed enormous trust in Yudhisthir and believed that Yudhisthir would never make a false statement and when Yudhisthir called out that Ashwathama was dead, he instantaneously believed it. In fact, Yudhisthir did not make any false statement either, did he? It was just presented in a way that seemed so. It was cleverly designed (by Krishna) to ensure that it was interpreted in the way it was intended to.\nThat is how the framing effect works. It is not the information, but the way it is presented that does the trick. The trick here is to ‘frame’ someone.\nThis sounds too pre-historic, eh? Worry not, from the Dwapar Yug to the Kali Yug, the framing effect shines bright.\nKali Yug and the age of (mis)information Look at some statements below.\n India has vaccinated only 3.1% of its population, a meagre number compared to the 41% vaccination rate in the US The number of vaccine doses given in India stands at 20.7Cr, a whopping 61% of the US population!  Or read how some similar yet strikingly different headlines would create extreme views in a readers mind:\n A staggering 20% of the Indian population is still reeling under the below poverty line (BPL) Positive signs for India as the population under BPL has seen a gradual decline from 40% in 2004 to 20% in 2015    India continues its slump at the Olympics. Wins only 1 bronze India creates history. Karnam Malleswari becomes the first Indian woman to win an Olympic medal    Out of 4, India is the worst team Indian team is the 4th best team in the world!   Interesting examples, but sound too far-fetched. How do they relate to me, hmmm?\nHold on!\nDo you go well with memes?  Framing Effect \nSeems familiar? Been in that situation? I’d bet you did!\nThe classic tale of discount marketing You are drawn to the discount ‘%’ more than the price itself. The discount % is perceived as saving, as a benefit. And the mind is tricked into believing that you are actually in for a good deal. A 50% off deal cannot be bad, right?\nThis trick is used in a myriad number of ways. Let’s see.  Shoe Store Discount \nA shoe store displays 40% off. You get lured, you enter the store and try different shoes. However, you notice that the 40% off is only on a few shoes displayed at the corner, as part of the clearance sale, not on all the shoes. But having entered the store already you are reluctant to leave now. And inside the store, the sales agents are ready to entice you more, serve you more and make you feel like their hero. And you try more shoes. The chances are you end up buying a different shoe than what you anticipated when you entered. Happened with you?\nAnother example.  Fat Free Ice-cream \nTwo ice-cream boxes containing the same ingredients display their contents differently. The first box says ‘10% fat’, the second box says ‘90% fat-free!’. It is highly likely that, given a chance, you would choose the second box more often than the first one.\nOther variants of the discount displays include ‘up to 60% off’, ’50% off, offer ends tonight’, ’20% cashback’, ’60% off up to ₹50’ (this is the most ridiculous of all). They all make you feel bad for NOT using them; you may not realise that, but they do! And you want to avoid this ‘bad’ feeling and allow ourselves to be ‘framed’.\nFraming Effect  We often draw different conclusions from the same information depending on how it is presented.\n The framing effect perhaps is one of the most common tricks used by marketers, politicians, news agencies, influencers and not to forget — magicians. As the name itself says, it ‘frames’ the audience into believing what they see (or hear as it was in Dronacharya’s case), depending on how the information is presented. And based on the way information is presented, we draw different conclusions from it — to support a party or not, to buy a shoe or not, to trust a person or not — we do it almost all the time. You could draw a completely wrong conclusion and only realise it much later or not realise it at all! You could have drawn an entirely different conclusion had the information been presented in any different way.\nPoliticians and the art of framing Some more examples 😀\n The government will glorify the fact that it was able to pave way for a cashless economy due to demonetization but will hide the fact that the currency in circulation, according to the RBI data, was ₹24.2 lakh crore in 2020 compared to ₹16.4 lakh crore in 2016. And also cover it under the rugs that as per the RBI data, about 99% of the invalidated money was returned to the banks. Remember flushing out black money was a prime objective of demonetization? But the government will never bring them to light themselves. The government will call for caution, solidarity and brotherhood among fellow people during these tough Covid times, but will underplay misgovernance and systemic failure at the topmost level.  I can go on and on with various examples about how clever our people are in framing things and playing it so subtly that you don’t even realise.\nWhat am I trying to say, anyway? Anyway, coming to the point. The information you consume, from the people you know, from advertisements, from strangers on social media, from newspapers or any other media — they all bear a very high power to influence us. It can sway us away from one view to another extreme view, merely by the way information is presented.\nPeople tend to present information that suits their narrative, in a way that doesn’t harm them but helps them. It is natural. It stems from the need for self-protection and preservation. People don’t give away their shortcomings as easily as they glorify their virtues.\nIn fact, the onus of identifying the shortcomings (or all the facts) is on the other person. This is prevalent in almost everything you do — purchasing a car, downloading an App, ordering food, looking for a match on matrimony, voting in an election, selecting an insurance plan — the list is endless.\nIn fact, ‘Caveat Emptor’, a Latin phrase, which can be loosely translated into English as ‘let the buyers beware’ is a law in commercial transactions. It places the onus on the buyer to perform due diligence before making a purchase and doesn’t necessarily hold the seller responsible for not disclosing everything — for a simple reason that it is impossible to state ‘everything’ about a product/service. For example, if you want to buy a car from me, I may NOT be able to give the entire history of the car, if it had any accident, how many times was the car taken for servicing, if the windshield is in perfect condition etc. It is your responsibility to check everything that you need to know before you make the payment. By law, the onus is on you while making a purchase.\nAnd this rule, if not law, can be extended beyond commercial transactions. While consuming information, the onus is on the receiver to get the complete information. There always will be grey areas in the information presented and you need to be careful while you draw conclusions from the information presented as it is.\nThis happens all the time — from making new friends to planning a trip, from finding a partner to buying a new house, from choosing a college to starting a company. It is better to take a step back and look at the information from an objective eye by asking more questions and asking for more information. This is difficult and cannot be done all the time. But if not paid enough attention, this could take you for a ride.\n Thank you for reading! 🙏🏼\n👍🏼 ➡️ If you liked it, please share it with others who might find it interesting!\n💬 Also, please leave your comment or feedback below.\n ","date":"2021-06-21T23:41:24+05:30","image":"https://stack-test-a41a1.web.app/p/framing-effect/framing_hu913944859529bb6f629ec835282bdf41_234021_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://stack-test-a41a1.web.app/p/framing-effect/","title":"05 Framing Effect"},{"content":"👋🏼 Hello! Thank you for stopping by!\n😀 Please note that this is the fourth in a series of articles I am writing on Cognitive Biases. If you haven’t read the other three yet, I’d recommend you read them first. Links below:\n Confirmation Bias ✅ Fundamental Attribution Error ✅ Ikea effect ✅   Let’s get started with this one.\nThe geyser story Last year, we moved into our newly built house in Hyderabad. Nothing fancy, just a decent one with a few more comforts compared to the old house. For one, the new house had a facility for geyser whereas the old one didn’t.\nOne of my school friends, Naresh, visited us when we were getting the geysers fitted. We had ordered Havells geysers from Amazon. They seemed fine, the power rating, the warranty, the make of the product and the price — they fit our requirement.\nWhat amazed me was what happened after that. When Naresh wanted to buy geysers for his home, he too ordered the ‘Havells geysers from Amazon’. They performed well and were energy efficient, after all, and it made sense to order the same product he thought. All he did was, he searched for Havells geysers on Amazon, placed the order and they got delivered. Only, there was one problem — the geyser did not fit the height in his bathroom! He did not check that, the geyser did not fit his requirements. And he had to replace it!\nSo, what happened here? Naresh was presented with a similar situation as I. He just reproduced what I did as if it was the natural thing to do. In fact, it sounds fairly simple too — When I wanted to have a geyser, I ordered a Havells from Amazon and when Naresh wanted to have a geyser, he too ordered a Havells from Amazon, because it worked for me. He took my geyser as an example and applied it in his judgement!\nI realised, when we are in a situation where we are supposed to decide if something works or not, we most often think of the situations in the past and identify what had worked already and reproduce the same. Seems like a fully scientific approach, right? We are using historic data to predict what needs to be done in the future. However, there is one catch. A big one.\nYou see, we, humans, are not computers. Our ability to recollect data and information and process it is limited. We do not see the entire context as clearly. Our natural tendency is to process only that information that is very vivid in our mind. And whatever is vivid doesn’t necessarily mean that it is sufficient and that could lead to some potential errors. So, it requires quite an additional effort to actually process the information in its entirety to avoid errors. But, as you know, our brain is lazy to do that.\nSpeaking in statistical terms, the sample size or the number of data points we could recollect and process at a time is very minimal. Though the capacity of our brain is unbelievably large, it is just not a natural thing for us to process such larger portions in a very short span of time. Because our life demands us to make decisions all the time, we tend to use the references which are very fresh in our memory to arrive at decisions rather quickly. And if we make the decisions based on the ‘notions’ derived from such a small sample (of memories), we are prone to what is called a Type II error in statistics. It means that due to the small sample size, we conclude that our hypothesis is true, when, in fact, the hypothesis is not true. That means, if we are given a larger number of samples (memories), we would have arrived at a different conclusion, after all.\nIn the behavioural sciences world, the phenomenon of arriving at conclusions based on the examples we can immediately recollect is called the ‘Availability Heuristic.’\nAvailability Heuristic  We rely on immediate examples that come to our mind while making judgements.\n  Availability Heuristic \nThe Shawshank Redemption Sometime back, a group of our friends went for a drive outside of the city. There were a bunch of people whom I met for the first time and made some new friends too. As I was discussing with a girl, she asked me to suggest some good movies to watch. Without any further questions or thoughts, I started to blurt out my favourite movie names, movies which I felt were good — the typical must-watch list — which included The Shawshank Redemption, Shutter Island, The Schindler’s List, The Godfather, some of Nolan’s, and some newly released movies on Netflix and Prime.\nLittle did I try to actually find out what her interests were or what she liked to watch before suggesting anything! And as it turned out, she watched The Shawshank Redemption and did not find it as compelling as I thought it would! I couldn’t understand why would someone not like such a beautiful movie!\nWhat I did there — which, I think, most of you also do — was resorting to a list of movies which I had in my mind, ready as examples to be given to anyone who wanted to watch a movie. The examples were ready, they only needed an avenue to come out and these movies had to be good for everybody, I thought. I was wrong.\nWondering why I am making such a fuss about just watching a movie?\nAllow me, I am trying to arrive at something here, will you?\nSome other examples You are chilling out with your friends. After a week full of busy office work, you finally get to relax! If a discussion comes up whether it is the government’s failure to control Covid or if it was people’s negligence — which side would you take and whom do you blame? I am sure you won’t do a root cause analysis to arrive at this conclusion. Some would probably quote a few instances where the government was absolutely foolish and some would say that the public behaved irresponsibly and brought it on to themselves. Or some argue for both sides.\nIn any case, all these discussions are drawn from the examples you and your friends can recollect. But, how good are those examples to actually validate the blame? They are too subjective to even compare and say that one stands way over the above, but our mind forms some heuristics to do this comparison. It somehow can reduce this hugely complex problem to a set of a few examples, and you don’t realise that. You don’t realise that your notions and conclusions can be grossly inaccurate.\nWhen posed with a situation of ‘why is India not doing well?’, you tend to recollect examples of superficial things, like the population, literacy, pollution, unemployment among others which are very clear in your memory, of which you have an example or two to present as an argument to validate your views. But you don’t realise that these are not sufficient to establish your argument. These are only the things that are available to your memory, to state as examples. They are not sufficient.\nMore examples  You are not promoting a deserving candidate— ‘When I had an interaction with her last time, she seemed very immature.’ Which restaurant to go to for dinner? — ‘Where did we go last time?’ What food to order? — ‘What did we order last time, either order the same thing or order anything other than that?’ Want to buy a new hair straightener? — ‘Which brand’s Ad did I see recently?’ Feeling lazy to choose what to wear to the office? — ‘Which dress gave me good compliments from a bunch of people?’ Is he a good guy? — ‘What did my friend tell me about him?’ Is this investment worth it? — ‘Did it work for others I know?’  So, what’s the problem with this, anyway? Wouldn’t you curse Netflix if it only shows you video recommendations based on just the recent browsing history and not considering all your older watch history? Wouldn’t that be irritating? Wouldn’t you be annoyed at how lame the recommendations are? What you like to watch cannot just be based on one day’s activity, right?\nSimilarly, just like how Netflix’s recommendation system works, you too should not judge anything or anyone based on one or two examples that come to your mind.\nLet’s look at a few more examples that can take a hit on your pocket straight away. Maybe, then you’d realise the importance ;)\nIt was the August of 2020. If you follow the world of commodities, you would know that the gold prices hit an all-time high! Many of my friends had bought gold; gold seemed to be a good investment, after all. However, one friend, unfortunately, saw this trend. He badly wanted to invest his money and even asked me for better ways of investment — I couldn’t help as I am no good — So, when he saw that others already made good profits from gold, he wanted to do just that! He bought ₹2,00,000 worth of gold at a whopping ₹5,600/gram! That’s it… Bam! As you must be guessing, the prices fell from there… He lost ₹20,000 in one day and is still hoping the price to climb up. But hey, the current price is nowhere near that point!\nOh, wait! This happened pretty recently too… Does Doge strike a chord?\nJust because you have vivid examples of others who made profits from a particular investment, you cannot judge that it is going to be good for you too, right? By looking at an example just as an example without the constraints and the context it is operating in, you cannot make a correct judgement.\nThey say, information is wealth, but ensure that you have the complete information, not just a few examples to suit your narration.\nHmm. Gotcha.\nWhy do we have this bias, anyway? All cognitive biases are based on the fact that our brain is lazy and doesn’t want to do any work unless necessary. That it wants to waste as few resources as possible and consume lesser and lesser energy. And use it only when needed, in the best possible way. However, for the brain to take the best possible way and use the resources in an efficient way we have to train it! But we don’t do that very often, do we?\nWhenever there is a need to process information, the mind looks for the easiest possible way to do it. Of the many ways and shortcuts which the mind takes — I discussed a few of these in my previous articles Confirmation Bias and IKEA effect — finding a similar example for comparison is probably more qualified yet an easier option.\nWhen you judge someone or something, you automatically scan for a benchmark — a benchmark in that category or in that field or in that country or in that region or the community or in that era. Anything that could be used to form some notion about whether this someone or something is good in comparison with the immediate examples that occur to you, that you could recollect.\nBut that’s not how judgements are supposed to be made — read my article on Fundamental Attribution Error where I talk about how judgements should usually be made.\nSo, how to avoid falling into these pitfalls?  Try and avoid getting into ‘urgent’ situations. Give your mind enough time and resources to take a calculated decision. This could be done by avoiding getting into ‘urgent’ situations as much as possible. Do research. When you know that you just have one example which you are using to conclude, look out for more examples. Look out for more data points. Look out for more evidence. Do not decide straight off the bat. Discuss and deliberate. Many times we do not know whether it came from one example or multiple data points. We do not know whether our choice is the best one or not. It is safe to discuss and deliberate on your choices with others whom you trust.  Have any other suggestions to avoid these pitfalls?

Thank you for stopping by.\n😀 Please note that this is the third in a series of articles I am writing on Cognitive Biases. If you haven’t read the other two yet, I’d recommend you read them first. Links below:\n Confirmation Bias ✅ Fundamental Attribution Error ✅   Ok, let’s get started with this one.\n🚀 WhatsDplan In 2015, Ramesh Kumar Katreddi and I started WhatsDplan. We had deliberated quite a lot on the product we wanted to build and out of the numerous ideas we had, we narrowed it down to one and started building it. We had quit our jobs and laboured day and night to build the best product we could.\nWe were building an event planning application for friends. We loved the idea from the beginning and we thought that the product we were building would be loved by everyone around, used by many and would be an instant hit. As naive as it may sound, I did think that WhatsDplan was a breakthrough product! I mean why would anyone not like such a beautiful product, right!\nAs it turned out, I was wrong. People did not use it as much as I thought they would. In fact, people did not use it at all! There were hardly any repeat users and the number of users dipped day by day. I was gutted and there was nothing I could do about it. My heart sank and I felt devastated. I still hoped that something miraculous would happen for people to realise its value. And, of course, nothing miraculous happened!\nWe started working on the App idea because we loved it and put our heart, blood and sweat into developing it. If you ask any startup founder you will get the same answer. But, does that mean that others also would value our product as much as we do? Most of the time, the answer is no. It was only much later that I realised that our App did not provide much value to the users and they did not like it as much as we did.\nI realised that for the things I create, people do not assign the same amount of value as I do. In fact, I realised I assign a disproportionately high amount of value to the things that I create, but others don’t.\nNot just me, you too are the greatest lover of your work, aren’t you? You too would have a thing or two in your closet that you value a lot, right? A childhood sketch maybe? Or a painting or a hand-written note or the prizes you’d won! Don’t you value them so much? You don’t realise, but you probably value them very highly! More so, if you are an artist, you are likely to value your video or a song or a film or a poem or even a piece of quote/tagline more highly than your friends’ who do similar work!\nBut why do we attach so much value to things we create? There’s a reason.\n🎇 The IKEA effect  The IKEA effect simply says that we place a higher value on things we partially created ourselves.\n  Ikea effect \nOne of the many Cognitive Biases, the IKEA effect draws its name from the world-famous Swedish furniture company, IKEA.\nAt IKEA, you don’t always get a fully assembled product. In many cases, you get parts of the furniture in boxes and you assemble them yourself. And as it happens, because you are assembling your furniture, you assign more value to it and hence are more likely to go back to IKEA again than any other furniture store. Pretty smart, eh!\nThe word ‘IKEA effect’ was first coined by Michael Nortan, Daniel Mochon and Dan Ariely in their 2012 paper titled ‘IKEA effect: When labour leads to love.’ The paper opens with a famous ‘instant cake mixes’ story from the 1950s.\nLong story short, when the instant cake mixes were introduced into the market, they did not perform well. The sales did not pick up. When the manufacturers studied the reasons for why such a good product was not picking up, they found that the instant cake mixes took away the need to ‘put in the effort’ to make cakes at home. They made the housewives think that it made cooking too easy and they did not value them as much. By removing the need for effort and labour, the cake mixes de-valued themselves instead of improving the value. So, later, when the manufacturers re-launched them by introducing an extra step where the housewives had to add an egg into the mix before baking, they gained popularity and it was a hit!\nWe, as humans, have the psychological need to feel competent, that we are capable of doing something and can learn and overcome obstacles. We don’t like to be seen as incompetent or foolish. This could be linked to the time when a man’s survival depended on his competence and his ability — to hunt and to safeguard himself and his family. Not just for survival, but also for his status, his power and improving his chances of mating — they all demanded his competency. This is true even to this day.\nAnother reason why the IKEA effect happens is ‘Effort Justification’. When we work hard for something, we tend to believe that all our effort was for a good reason, that there was a purpose which we were working towards. And no matter what the outcome, we place more value on it because we worked hard for a good reason in the first place. We think we are rational and want to justify that all that time and effort are not mere wastes! So, we convince ourselves that our ‘thing’ is more valuable than others.\nWhen we create something, we not only feel good at the moment, but it also fulfils a deep psychological need. We derive happiness and the feeling of happiness gets etched in our memory. And when we create something, we find it to be more valuable than it is because of this extra dose of happiness it gives us.\n📑 Some examples Think about it, which one would you value more: a greeting card with a long personal note you wrote yourself or a greeting card that has a well-written thank you note by a professional? You likely value the card with your personal message more than the other although the message on the professional card is better in every way — in terms of content, emotions, grammar and presentation!\nAnother example, if you haven’t already, bake a cake! I bet you’d value it more than the most delicious cake from the best bakery in the world!\nNot just in personal lives, it happens at our workplace too. You spend a lot of time in research, deliberate a lot and propose an idea to a problem. You instantly fall in love with the idea — no matter how bad or impractical it is. You think that it is great and is worth giving a shot.\nOr you work hard and execute a project to completion. You think that it is worthy of the ‘best project’ award. However, it baffles you when your manager doesn’t give you any recognition!\n🤔 Is that wrong? You might say, of course, you value things more because of your emotional attachment with them because you created them and only you know how hard you worked for it. And this is good. Valuing things is good. Because you value things, you take care of them, you ensure their longevity and nurture them if required. This leads to a more caring, loving and sustainable world — a better place to live, after all!\nHowever, if your biased decision-making affects others’ lives then there is a problem. This cannot be ignored. That would not make the world just. As a society, we need to consider others’ interests as well to make it a better place.\n📑More examples Consider an example, a politician is adamant about not revoking a policy just because he spent many months creating it although the policy is irrelevant in the present day and is affecting millions of people. Or your manager who doesn’t change an existing process because she had spent innumerable hours devising the process a couple of years ago and works just fine even today, or so she thinks! However, it is you and your team who are facing the brunt of it.\nOr you work the whole night analysing the market and arrive at some conclusive finding to improve your company revenue. However, in the morning you find some evidence which renders your findings inconclusive. Yet, you go ahead and discuss the actionable based on your analysis from the night.\nOr as a manager, when you have an option to choose between your work and your subordinate’s, you disregard the work by your subordinate even though you know deep down that her work is better than yours!\nSounds unfair, right? It is! And we all are party to it, thanks to our lazy and self-obsessed mind.\n💎 So, how to avoid this? I could think of a few ways, you can add more in the comments!\n🩺 Take a second opinion\nWhen you are deeply engrossed in your creation you do not realise its disadvantages. You tend to think that all is good and get blindsided. So, it is always good to take a second opinion, run it with others and be open for feedback. In most cases, you are not an expert in the area you are working on, so it is always better to be open to expert opinions and other ideas as well.\nFor example, if you made a new Sales deck, run it by your colleagues and ask for feedback. Don’t assume that it is the best deck on the planet.\n❤️ Think from a third-person’s point of view\nThinking from someone else’s point of view is not easy. It needs a lot of empathy and empathy is not developed overnight. But, with experience and by talking to more and more people you will have it. And once you have it, it is only a question of whether or not you are willing to make that extra effort to put yourself in the other person’s shoe.\nFor example, if you prepared a plan for your kids for the summer vacation, try and get a grasp of what they think of it. Do they like it too?\n🧐 Read the environment And when people do not directly give you the feedback or share how they feel, you need to go out of your way to see how they are responding. Watch out for signs yourself. Do they really like it too or is it just your belief? Is your work affecting them in any adverse way? Is there anything you could do to make things better?\nFor example, if you launched a new leave policy at the workplace, listen to the chatter around. Listen to what the employees are saying about it. Are there any changes you should do to the policy?\n⛔ Be ready to accept failure All your efforts won’t be fruitful. All your creations won’t be great. You must accept that. Most of your works fail. And from failures, you learn. Only when you accept the fact that your work is not great is when you strive to create something remarkable. And when you strive for something truly remarkable — you usually end up doing that!\nEg.: Well, no examples for this one! 😜\n Thank you for reading! 🙏🏼\n👍🏼 ➡️ If you liked it, please share it with others who might find it interesting!\n💬 Also, please leave your comment or feedback below.\n ","date":"2021-06-21T22:54:56+05:30","image":"https://stack-test-a41a1.web.app/p/ikea-effect/ikea_hu836d32aa1a5c6856263d2a6647cb78f0_215927_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://stack-test-a41a1.web.app/p/ikea-effect/","title":"03 Ikea effect"},{"content":"👋🏼 Hello! Thank you for stopping by.\nPlease note that this is the second in a series of articles I am writing on Cognitive Biases. If you haven’t read the first article yet, I’d recommend you read that first 😀. Link below:\n Confirmation Bias ✅   Fundamental Attribution Error  The Fundamental Attribution Error basically says that we judge others based on their personality and fundamental character, but judge ourselves based on our situation and circumstances.\n  Fundamental Attribution Error \nTo explain this, I am going to take a rather filmy route. Please bear with me as I get into quite a few details of these film stories to drive home the point. If you are into movies, you’d enjoy it, I believe. Even otherwise, cut me some slack, would you?\nOkay, let’s get started.\nSection 375 Let’s look at the story of the movie Section 375. If you have watched it already, you’d be able to relate better, but for others, I’ve tried to lay the plot briefly below to give you enough context.\nThe movie is a very well written courtroom drama with Tarun Saluja (Akshaye Khanna) as the defence lawyer, Hiral Gandhi (Richa Chadda) as the prosecutor arguing rape charges filed by the victim Anjali Dangle (Meera Chopra) against Rohan Khurana (Rahul Bhatt).\nRohan, a successful Bollywood director and Anjali, a budding costume designer hoping to build a successful career in the industry, get along well in showbiz. Anjali bags a couple of big projects working under Rohan and is optimistic of a bright future.\nTheir relationship, however, turns into an affair and when things do not turn out well between the two is when the plot thickens. And it is unfortunate and absolutely miserable to see people in influential position misuse their power to personal whims and fancies.\nLong story short, one thing leads to another and Rohan (who is already married to Kainaaz Khurana) ends the affair suddenly and withdraws Anjali from all the ongoing projects. From working on a few big projects and making a name for herself in the industry to losing everything instantly, reality hits Anjali hard. She realises this, apologises to Rohan and goes back to him to avoid any further lost opportunities. Taking advantage of his position, Rohan calls her to his residence and yet again, tries to exploit her of the situation, assaults her and forces her into having sex. Anjali couldn’t stand it any further, it was the end of the line for her.\nSo, as it happens, Anjali files a case against Rohan for rape and sexual assault. She presses charges and gains the media and public support overnight!\nThe rest of the case is discussed in a highly engaging courtroom drama. One thing I particularly like about this movie is how fine the dialogues are written and how the director, Ajay Bahl, explores a very controversial and uncomfortable territory.\nWith this backdrop and before discussing the movie any further, let’s look at a few things very objectively.\n Is Rohan a nice guy? Absolutely not. Did Rohan have a history of misbehaviour? Yes. Did Anjali have an affair with Rohan, knowing he is married? Yes. Did Anjali have consensual sex with Rohan before the rape incident? Yes. Does having a bad past make the accused guilty of current charges? No. Do we have strong proof of rape? Not rape, but marks of physical abuse and sex. And a confession by Anjali. Did Anjali have a blemishless history to take her word as gospel? No.  So, as you can see — the case stands on a knife’s edge. And in cases like these, the victim’s confession against the accused is sufficient to pronounce him guilty. And the court will decide that based on the facts, the evidence and the victim’s statement, which will be the final judgement and that is fine! And that’s exactly how a judgement is passed — after a thorough and unbiased examination of the facts and evidence, not from hearsay and definitely not because some section of the public thinks so.\nSo, what has this story got to do with Fundamental Attribution Error, you wonder?\nThe reason I gave this entire backdrop is to show the relevance and importance of context and facts before a judgement is passed about anything or anyone. And the ‘Fundamental Attribution Error’ I would like to refer to in this story is that made by the media and the public, people like you and me. People like us.\nIn this case, the defence lawyer, Tarun, was seen by the media and the public as the villain for defending the accused. In fact, even Hiral Gandhi, the prosecutor (who herself was Tarun’s student) was surprised at Tarun’s lack of awareness. She wondered how Tarun was not able to see things that clearly portrayed Rohan guilty and was surprised at how hard he was trying to defend Rohan of rape charges!\nThe media and public outrage are understandable — they are disgusted with such pathetic behaviour of men across industries, strata, and geographies. But are they right in calling the accused guilty already? Because people knew Rohan’s past and his character, they judged him based on his past and his character than the facts. And they believed it and could have bet their life on it. They believed they were right, no matter what the actual truth was. They knew that Rohan was a sick person, and hence must be the culprit.\nBut, is that the truth? Did their judgement stand on a strong ground? Were they prone to the fundamental attribution error? I guess so.\nAs it happens in the end, Anjali confesses to Hiral Gandhi that it was not rape. Anjali couldn’t digest the fact that she got those projects, not because of her talent and skills but because Rohan did her a favour by spending time with him. She felt like a whore, and was hurt. She wanted to take revenge. Cleverly, and with vengeance, she made a case for herself.\n I would have stretched the explanation by quite a bit on a very sensitive topic, you think. But let me tell you, it is prevalent in many and very mundane real-life situations as well. But before going there, let me tell you another story.\nChak De! India Remember Kabir Khan from Chak De! India?\nThe movie opens with the final between India and Pakistan in the World Hockey Championship. Pakistan is leading 2–1. With 2 minutes to go India desperately need a goal. And luckily for India, they get a penalty shot. It is highly unlikely to not score a goal on a penalty shot. So, all the Indians, the team management, the entire team and the captain Kabir Khan — all are very hopeful of the goal.\nKabir Khan takes the shot and as the drama unfolds, he misses it! India loses the final!\nThe entire country is disappointed at the loss. The public outrage is palpable. The media accuses Kabir Khan of the loss. With a few pictures of Kabir Khan with the Pakistan players, it questions his patriotism. The question catches heat and in no time the public actually declares him as a traitor. A traitor who gave away the win to Pakistan. Kabir Khan’s neighbourhood disowned him. He and his family were forced to vacate and move to a new place.\nBut why? How did the public come to that conclusion?\nLet’s look at what happened.\n Do India-Pakistan matches carry an extra dose of emotions? Hell, yes! Did India lose the match against Pakistan? Yes, happens in sports. Was there a possibility that the loss was just circumstantial? Definitely. You can’t control everything that happens in a hockey match! People were outraged by the loss. Yes, understandable. The loss was attributed to Kabir Khan. Yes, understandable. He was the captain, after all. Did Kabir Khan deliberately lose the match? No! Kabir Khan was a Muslim. This shouldn’t matter, but it did for the public. Being a Muslim is attributed as favouritism to Pakistan. I guess this is a stretch, but again the public attributed it whatsoever! Displaying sportsmanship by shaking hands is attributed as anti-national. The public had taken it too far here.  Well, it may seem alright that people were outraged and furious about the loss and this kind of accusation could just have been an outpour of emotions. This, right here, is a Fundamental Attribution Error. When you look at it again, people were strongly carried away by their emotions because of the loss and believed that the loss was only because of Kabir Khan. Unfortunately, in that flurry of emotions, they took it too far, they declared him anti-national on the mere basis that he was a Muslim.\nAll this filmy Gyan is OK! Does this happen in real life too?\nWe make this kind of attribution errors in our life too! We jump to conclusions and judge others based on our prior notion, opinion and perception about them. If someone does something, we do not critically assess the situation and pass our judgement based on our preconceived notions in the spur of the moment. Though we think we are very rational, we are driven by emotions most of the time.\nLet me give you some examples. Real-ones this time :)\nPerformance appraisals! Do you feel that you are not being recognised? That your performance rating and salary hike is not as per your expectations despite working really hard and giving all you got because your boss is an idiot? But your colleague is well promoted and treated nicely because she maintains good terms with her manager despite not being very talented and hard-working as you are?\nDo you blame your poor performance on your boss but your colleague’s better rating on her character?\nI am not sure about you, but I certainly did. In one of my previous companies, I did not get the hike I expected, I blamed my poor performance on the market and my manager for not recognizing my efforts. I, in fact, was convinced that only those who are in the close network of the manager got the benefits, not all! I blamed my inability to perform on my circumstances and my manager.\nFast forward a few years, I now know that I was wrong! I know that I was naive. That growth requires effort and it can’t just merely be circumstantial. Now I don’t take others’ growth for granted just like mine!\nI mean, we wear different lens when we judge others and different (self-fulfilling) lens when we judge ourselves.  Tuhada Kutta Tommy, Sada Kutta Kutta? \nI get reminded of this meme, ‘tumhara kutta tommy, hamara kutta kutta?’ — says how self-serving we are, how we judge others to suit our convenience!\nWe favour our own people and disregard others. If we make some mistake, we blame it on the situation. But if the same mistake is made by others, we somehow know for a fact that it is because of their inability, their personality and their carelessness. We care less about the role of circumstances and situations in the case of others than in our own.\nI mean, we are not ready to cut someone some slack because of their past choices and past mistakes. We carry their past all through our life and use it to judge them. And judge them as per our convenience, to fit our narrative.\nSounds strange? Let’s look at some more examples…\n If someone fails an entrance exam, you say ‘he’s not capable.’ But, if you fail in the exam, the narrative changes to ‘I had a fever, I couldn’t study.’ If someone is good at sketching, ‘he’s just talented.’ And why don’t you sketch? ‘you know I don’t have time to practice.’ If a colleague takes a leave because he’s sick, you already know he is lying. But when you fall sick and skip work, nobody should blame you. If someone loses money in stocks, ‘she’s such a bad investor.’ But if you lose money in stocks, ‘the market crashed!’ If someone did not get selected for a job, ‘he was not qualified in the first place.’ But if you did not get selected, ‘the interviewer asked tough questions.’ If someone loses a game, ‘she was unfit, she shouldn’t have been selected.’ But if you lose a business deal, ‘they did not understand the benefits of our product.’  We also pass judgements based on mere appearances and personalities:\n A candidate is not well organized and well planned because he is wearing a wrinkled shirt in an interview. A girl is a slut because she is wearing a skirt. A girl is inviting you for sex because she is talking to you with a smile. Someone is lazy just because he is fat.  These judgements might be true in some cases. But they are most certainly NOT true all the time. We form these judgments because our mind is in a rush and our experience says that these are true most of the time.\nThe world is chaotic and we are trying to figure out our way through all this chaos. It’s like cracking a code or solving a puzzle. It appears very random at first, but as we solve it we see patterns and realise that we can crack the code by following those patterns.\nSimilarly, in life too, we are trying to find patterns around us — the way people talk, the way they eat, the way they commute, the way they dress, the way they treat others etc. And when we see a pattern, it gets registered in our mind. We use these patterns subsequently to navigate through the chaos and make choices quickly. That, however, doesn’t mean that the patterns hold good all the time. There could be and there will be deviations in the patterns. And in life, we should embrace these deviations.\nWe must be cognizant of the fact that our judgements could be wrong and think twice before we judge or comment on others.\n Thank you for reading! 🙏🏼\n👍🏼 ➡️ If you liked it, please share it with others who might find it interesting!\n💬 Also, please leave your comment or feedback below.\n ","date":"2021-06-21T19:55:13+05:30","image":"https://stack-test-a41a1.web.app/p/fundamental-attribution-error/fae_hu82c25fa98cd4e9a8103220017be4b8cb_203345_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://stack-test-a41a1.web.app/p/fundamental-attribution-error/","title":"02 Fundamental Attribution Error"},{"content":"Cognitive Biases Cognitive Biases are a set of unwritten guidelines that nudge us to make decisions and take actions. They reduce our mental or intellectual effort to process information and make rational choices. We generally follow them without our awareness and in total submission. We follow them as they reduce our cognitive overload.\nWe, very commonly, fall into the trap of these biases as they are easy to follow, reduce the stress and efforts to decide and take an action. Our brain is wired to process information only when necessary. It wants to off-load as much of its work as possible and go into the ‘chill zone’ as soon and as often as possible. It doesn’t want to be disturbed. It wants to be left alone!\nHence, we form some heuristics with which we process information without troubling the brain very much and very often.\n Confirmation Bias \nConfirmation Bias One such heuristic, one such bias, is the Confirmation Bias. Let me give you a situation.\nIn fact, go through this situation and think about what would you do in such a situation. Don’t lie to yourself — more likely than not, you are biased ;)\nOk, let’s see.\nYou are part of your school WhatsApp group. The group, which was formed 4 years ago, is moderately active. Members generally post birthday or anniversary wishes, news on current affairs, some memes and jokes.\nOne fine day, a discussion starts on Football. You don’t watch much Football and are just aware of only a few famous leagues and players. The discussion picks up heat, and some of your friends are madly debating about who is the best: Messi or Ronaldo!\nYou go away for an hour and when you come back, you see 937 unread messages. You go berserk. Stunned by this madness, you like to figure out who is the best yourself! And you have the greatest resort one can have to aid you in this endeavour, the all-knowing master of the universe: Google!\nSo, if you had to ask Google to find out who is actually ‘The Best’, what would you type? What would you search for?\nNow, pause for a moment and think.\nNo, really, pause and think. What is the phrase that you’d search in Google?\nI am serious. Pause and think!\nOk, did you think? Ready now? Fine.\nBefore reading further, write the phrase you’d search for in the comments below (or write it down somewhere) so that you have proof and you can lock it down. We will come back to it in a moment.\nYou can continue reading after you comment. Trust me, it will be fun.\nDone commenting?\nOk. Now that you’ve decided what you’d search for, let’s see the possibilities. I have written some possible searches and their results:\n is messi better than ronaldo is ronaldo better than messi why is messi better than ronaldo why is ronaldo better than messi who is better, messi or ronaldo who is the best between messi and ronaldo football statistics of messi and ronaldo  Of course, there could be many other combinations, but let us look at these.\nBased on the order in which you read those articles, you form some initial opinion about Messi and Ronaldo. You start to subscribe to what you read. And as each subsequent fact reinforces the previously read facts, your belief in it strengthens. Once you read a good number of articles (could just be 2 or 3), you will form a very strong opinion about each player.\nOptions 1, 2, 3, 4:\nPlease go through the below Google results carefully…  is one better than the other \nClearly, as you can see, these results are already biased towards one player (Messi) than the other! Google filters out articles for you that tend to argue that Messi is better than Ronaldo! And as you read one article after the other, the reinforcement (the confirmation of your beliefs) happens, you tend to subscribe to one school of thought. So, if you search ‘is messi better than ronaldo’, you are more likely to end up in the ‘Messi Clan’ than the ‘Ronaldo Clan’ as you read more articles that favour Messi over Ronaldo.\nAnd once you end up in that clan, you do not question your allegiance at all! Would you? I mean, according to you, you have searched by all fairness and Google is CLEARLY saying that Messi is better than Ronaldo. And you wouldn’t doubt the ‘all-knowing master’, would you? Hence you are right! Or, so you think!\nWell, a while ago, you did not have any connection with Football. You do not watch much of Football and do not have much knowledge about the players and probably have a piece of very poor knowledge about what’s happening in the Football world. Yet, here you are, almost convinced that Messi is better than Ronaldo.\nSimilar will be the search results for options 2, 3, and 4 — and you tend to form a strong opinion on either Messi or Ronaldo based on those articles.\nOptions 5, 6:\nPlease read these results carefully now…  who is better \nOn the other hand, searches 5 and 6 are not targeted to either Messi or Ronaldo and they give a set of partially unbiased results. Yet, these results are someone’s opinions about both the players. So, if the author of those articles is partially biased towards any player, that would reflect in the article as well.\nOption 7:\n player statistics \nThe search results for 7 give statistics about the players. They give details about the number of matches, goals, awards, possession time, win % etc. These will help you do an easy number-by-number comparison. However, comparing different kinds of numbers is also not easy. I mean, it is not possible to compare the number of goals to the ball possession time or the number of assists or the number of awards etc. Also, if you know a little about Football, you will know that the game is not just about numbers, after all!\nHow to actually compare then? If you really wanted to make such a comparison, you’d have to watch 100s of Football matches, read through 100s of player stats and study the hardships each player faced in their life among other things. And the best answer you could probably arrive at is that the comparison itself is futile! Each of them is ‘best’ in their own way… Or if you had to conclude, you’d be very specific and categorical in your answer instead of giving a generic statement like ‘Messi is better than Ronaldo’. Because the harder question people forget to ask here is what does ‘better’ actually mean?\nAnd, who really wants to go through this gruelling process of analysing the information in such an impartial way just to decide who is a better player, right! Instead, we tend to spend some time going through various videos and articles on the internet and form our own opinion as soon as possible.\nUnfortunately, it is not just for discussions like these but also for many important decisions in our life that we ignore such thinking. We do not want to burden ourselves so much in our daily decision making. We off-load as much thinking as possible and spend our mental energy only in certain situations — typically the office work!\nThis kind of confirmation bias happens all the time:\n Religious affiliations: Is Hinduism better than Christianity Political affiliations: Is Biden better than Trump National Affairs: Is the farm bill bad for the farmers Fanbases: Is Marvel better than DC Diet plans: Is Vegan better than Keto Global warming is not real Covid vaccines do not work  The list is endless!\nAs we are no experts in certain situations, we rely on the views or opinions of others on the subject and seek answers. However, rather than looking for answers, we should question what we are looking for! Sadly, that kind of questioning requires a lot of rationality and our mind is super lazy to do that! The mind would rather know the answer ready-made than actually probe further. It would take the answer on the face of it than question the correctness of the question itself!\n So, Confirmation Bias, basically, reinforces your already existing notions, beliefs, opinions, views, and expectations about anything. This helps us assess a situation faster, make decisions quickly and take necessary actions immediately. With that, we can spend our ‘mental energy’ on things that actually matter to us.\n This happens because our mind doesn’t like to be questioned. It doesn’t want to be challenged. It doesn’t want to lose. It wants to win. It wants to be satisfied. The moment it finds that what it thinks is true, it becomes happy and reinforces that thought and tends to relax without any effort to validate it further. It requires an extra push to take the next step and validate further and we don’t want to give that extra push!\nOn the other hand, if it finds out anything contrary to the existing beliefs and expectations, it denies, resists, becomes restless and unhappy. And the mind tries very hard to avoid such situations and the easy way to do that is to comply with anything that reinforces the existing beliefs without questioning further.\nSo, the next time, when you think you are sure of something, that you are not biased in what you are saying and that you make total sense… Think again!\n Thank you for reading! 🙏🏼\n👍🏼 ➡️ If you liked it, please share it with others who might find it interesting!\n💬 Also, please leave your comment or feedback below.\n ","date":"2021-05-02T23:10:47+05:30","image":"https://stack-test-a41a1.web.app/p/confirmation-bias/football_hubb7f093e94e52d7fb5a0d9995b405d4b_758522_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://stack-test-a41a1.web.app/p/confirmation-bias/","title":"01 Confirmation Bias"}]
