      <description>It would be foolish of me if I proclaim that I was able to understand everything discussed in the book. ‘The Heartfulness Way’ is not a preaching which is to be read and understood in the first place. It, rather, is a way of life which needs to be practiced, experienced and felt deep inside. It helps in giving a direction and presents a way to look into one’s own self, lead a peaceful life and attain the real purpose of our life.</description>
