      <description>Let’s go back to the 1600s for a while.

If not, he is the one known for his famous experiment of dropping two objects of different weights from the ‘Leaning Tower of Pisa’.

      <title>01 Confirmation Bias</title>

      <description>Cognitive Biases Cognitive Biases are a set of unwritten guidelines that nudge us to make decisions and take actions. They reduce our mental or intellectual effort to process information and make rational choices. We generally follow them without our awareness and in total submission. We follow them as they reduce our cognitive overload.
We, very commonly, fall into the trap of these biases as they are easy to follow, reduce the stress and efforts to decide and take an action.</description>

      <title>Hooked - book review</title>
      <link>https://arjunuvacha.com/p/hooked-book-review/</link>

      <description>Hooked is one of those books which I would recommend to every aspiring Product Manager. In fact, anyone who is even sparsely connected with human psychology or behaviour should read this. It is a short, quick read and insightful with some clever real-world examples.
While reading the book, I had collated some important and wow moments in my notepad. I wanted to share them with others and thus this article. Please note that this in no way is the gist of the book!</description>
